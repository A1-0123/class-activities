# pseudocode

pseudocode is a simple language for writing algorithms. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to be easy to translate into other languages.

Pseudocode is a type of informal high-level description of the steps of an algorithm, or a program. It is similar to a programming language, but it is not meant to be executed on a computer. Instead, it is intended for human understanding and is often used to plan or describe the logic of a program before it is written in a formal programming language.


## Example

```js
1. To find the largest number in a list of numbers:
    list = [ 1, 2, 51, 75, 22, 10 ]
   - Set a variable 'largest' to the first number in the list
   - For each remaining number in the list:
       - If the number is greater than 'largest', set 'largest' to that number
   - Print the value of 'largest'

2. To sort a list of numbers in ascending order:
   - Repeat until the list is sorted:
       - Set a variable 'swapped' to false
       - For each element in the list:
           - If the element is greater than the next element:
               - Swap the two elements
               - Set 'swapped' to true
       - If 'swapped' is false, the list is sorted

3. To calculate the factorial of a number:
    - Set a variable 'result' to 1
    - For each number from 1 to the given number:
        - Multiply 'result' by the number
    - Return 'result'
```

As you can see, pseudocode is usually written in plain English and is easy to understand. It can be used by developers or non-developers to understand the logic of an algorithm or program before it is implemented.

```js
To add two numbers together:

Input first number
Input second number
Set a variable 'sum' equal to the first number plus the second number
Print the value of 'sum'
---

To determine if a number is even or odd:

Input a number
If the number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0
Print "even"
Else
Print "odd"

---
To calculate the average of a list of numbers:
    list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
Input a list of numbers

Set a variable 'sum' to 0
For each number in the list:
Add the number to 'sum'
Set a variable 'average' to 'sum' divided by the number of elements in the list
Print the value of 'average'

---
To print out "Hello, World!"
Print "Hello, World!"
```

As you can see, these examples are written in a simple and easy-to-understand manner and use common mathematical operations and simple control flow statements. Pseudocode can be as simple or complex as the problem it describes, but the main point is that it should be easy to understand and convey the logic of the algorithm or program.
