1. Install Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system, as Create React App requires Node.js to run. You can download and install the latest LTS version from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

2. Install Create React App: Open your terminal or command prompt and install Create React App globally by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

3. Create a new React app: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app and run the following command:
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   This will create a new directory named `my-app` with the basic structure and files for a React application.

4. Remove unnecessary files: By default, Create React App generates some files and folders that you might not need for a minimalist setup. You can remove them if they are not required for your project. Common files that you may consider removing include:
   - `src/App.css`
   - `src/App.test.js`
   - `src/index.css`
   - `src/logo.svg`
   - `src/serviceWorker.js`
   - `src/setupTests.js`

5. Simplify the remaining files: If you want to further reduce the complexity, you can modify the remaining files according to your requirements. For example:
   - In `src/App.js`, remove unnecessary code and simplify the component structure.
   - In `src/index.js`, remove any unwanted imports and simplify the rendering logic.

6. Start the development server: Once you have simplified your files, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will run your minimalist React app and open it in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

With these steps, you can create a minimalist React application using Create React App tooling. Remember that the level of minimalism can vary based on your project requirements, so feel free to adjust the setup to suit your needs.

2. Install Create React App: Open your terminal or command prompt and install Create React App globally by running the following command:

   ```

3. Create a new React app: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app and run the following command:
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-basic
   ```
   The `cra-template-basic` template provides a minimal setup without including any additional features or files.

4. Remove unnecessary files: Once the app is created, navigate to the project directory and remove the unnecessary files and folders. Common files that you may consider removing include:
   - `src/App.css`
   - `src/App.test.js`
   - `src/logo.svg`
   - `src/reportWebVitals.js`
   - `public/logo192.png`
   - `public/logo512.png`
   - `public/robots.txt`

   Make sure to review the files and remove only those that are not required for your specific project.

5. Simplify the remaining files: Modify the remaining files according to your project requirements. You can simplify the code in `src/App.js` and other components as needed.

6. Start the development server: Once you have simplified the files, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will run your minimalist React app and open it in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

By following these steps, you can create a minimalist React application using Create React App without including test and report-related files and dependencies. Remember to adjust the setup based on your specific project needs.

Create React App provides different templates that you can choose from to scaffold your React application. Each template includes a predefined project structure, configuration, and dependencies. Here are the commonly used templates and what they include:

1. `cra-template` (default template):
   - React with JavaScript or TypeScript
   - Babel for transpiling JavaScript
   - Webpack for module bundling
   - Jest for testing
   - ESLint for code linting
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Stylelint for CSS linting
   - Various default configuration files

2. `cra-template-pwa` (Progressive Web App template):
   - Includes all features from the default template
   - Service Worker for offline caching
   - Manifest file for adding the app to the home screen on mobile devices

3. `cra-template-redux` (Redux template):
   - Includes all features from the default template
   - Redux for state management
   - React Redux for integrating Redux with React
   - Redux Toolkit for simplifying Redux setup

4. `cra-template-typescript` (TypeScript template):
   - Includes all features from the default template
   - Uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript for development
   - TypeScript-specific configuration files and dependencies

5. `cra-template-basic` (Basic template):
   - Minimal template without any additional features or dependencies
   - Only includes the essential setup for a React application

These are the main templates provided by Create React App. By selecting the appropriate template, you can start your React project with a predefined structure and configuration that aligns with your project requirements. If you need specific features like Redux or TypeScript, choosing the relevant template can save you time by setting up the necessary dependencies and configurations.
