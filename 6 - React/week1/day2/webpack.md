**What is Webpack?**

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph that maps every module your project needs and generates one or more "bundles".

In simpler terms, you can think of webpack as a tool that takes all your JavaScript files (plus other files like CSS and images, if you set it up to do so) and combines them into a single file (or multiple files) that's ready to be served to your users.

**Why use Webpack?**

There are several reasons why you might want to use webpack:

1. **Code Organization:** Webpack lets you split your codebase into multiple chunks, which are loaded on demand. This is a boon for large applications as it helps in organizing the code and making it more maintainable.

2. **Performance:** By bundling your files, webpack can significantly improve load times, especially if you have a large number of small files. It does this by reducing the number of HTTP requests your client's browser needs to make. Webpack also supports various optimizations like minification and tree shaking to further reduce bundle size.

3. **Transpiling:** Webpack doesn't transpile JavaScript or preprocess CSS out of the box, but through the use of loaders (more on that below), it can be set up to do so. This makes webpack a key part of using modern JavaScript (ES6+) and CSS (Sass, Less) features or JSX syntax in your project.

4. **Development Server:** Webpack's development server provides live reloading out of the box. This is a big productivity boost as it automatically updates the page whenever you save changes to files in your project.

**Using Webpack with React:**

Webpack is a crucial part of the React ecosystem for several reasons:

1. **JSX:** React introduces JSX, an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript. Browsers can't handle JSX directly, so we need to transform it into regular JavaScript before the browser can understand it. Webpack helps us do this with the help of Babel and specific webpack loaders.

2. **Development Server:** As mentioned above, the webpack development server automatically refreshes the page whenever you save files. This works great with React where you often want to see your changes immediately.

3. **Optimization:** Webpack helps to optimize the React applications by minifying the JavaScript and CSS files, removing comments, and other unnecessary spaces, thus reducing the load time.

4. **Code Splitting:** In large React applications, you can split your code into multiple chunks using webpack. This allows for loading pieces of your app on demand, leading to faster initial load times. 

In practice, you'll often use webpack together with Babel when working with a React application. Babel will transpile the JSX into JavaScript that the browser can understand, while webpack will bundle these JavaScript files along with any other assets into a package that can be served to the client.
