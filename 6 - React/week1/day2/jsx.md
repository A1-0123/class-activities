**What is JSX?**

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript, developed by Facebook, and primarily used with React. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript. These HTML-like tags are not exclusive to HTML but can also represent custom React components. 

For example:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

**Why Use JSX?**

1. **Component Structure:** JSX provides an intuitive way to structure your components in a way that is easy to understand and read. When you look at JSX code, you can see the layout takes the form of HTML but represents components.

2. **JavaScript Power:** Since JSX is JavaScript, you can use JavaScript expressions right inside your JSX using curly braces `{}`. You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. For example:

   ```jsx
   const name = 'John Doe';
   const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
   ```

3. **Optimization:** JSX compiles into `React.createElement()` calls, which means it's optimized for performance. The React team has made several optimizations to how this works to make it as fast as possible.

4. **Safety:** JSX prevents injection attacks. It's safe to embed user input in JSX because React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.

**Why You Might Not Use JSX?**

Some developers prefer not to use JSX for a variety of reasons:

1. **Learning Curve:** Developers coming from an MVC background might find JSX to be a little hard to understand at first, especially the idea of mixing JavaScript with HTML-like syntax.

2. **Complexity:** JSX can potentially lead to overly complex components. Since HTML and JavaScript are written in the same file using JSX, it could lead to more complex and harder-to-maintain code.

3. **Tooling:** Some developers may have preferences for certain tools or environments that do not have good JSX support. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, most modern development environments do support JSX.

**How is it Possible to Use HTML-like Syntax in JavaScript?**

This is where Babel comes into play. Browsers can't interpret JSX directly. When a file containing JSX is transpiled, Babel transforms the JSX (an XML-like syntax) into standard JavaScript.

For example, it transforms this:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

Into this:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
```

`React.createElement()` is part of the React library and it's how React creates a new React element, which is the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. 

So it's not that browsers are interpreting the HTML-like syntax in JavaScript directly. Instead, JSX is being transpiled into JavaScript that browsers can interpret.
