Creating a new repository on GitHub is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Sign In to GitHub**: First, you'll need to sign in to your GitHub account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free on the [GitHub website](https://github.com).

2. **Create a New Repository**: Once you've logged in, you should see a "+" icon at the upper right corner of the page next to your profile picture. Click on it, then select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Set Repository Details**: On the next page, you will need to provide some details about your repository:

    - **Repository name**: Choose a name for your repository. It should be something descriptive that tells you (and others) what the project is about.
    
    - **Description** (Optional): You can provide a brief description of what your project does. This will be displayed below the repository name on GitHub.

    - **Public/Private**: If you choose "Public", anyone will be able to see your repository and its contents. If you choose "Private", only you and the people you invite will be able to see it.

    - **Initialize this repository with**: You can choose to add a README file, a .gitignore file, or choose a license right away if you want. A README file is a good place to provide more detailed information about your project, while a .gitignore file tells Git which files or types of files to ignore when making commits. A license dictates how others can use, modify, and distribute your project.

4. **Create Repository**: After filling in the details, click the "Create repository" button at the bottom. Congratulations! You've just created a new repository on GitHub.

Remember, once the repository is created, you can clone it to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository-url>` where `<repository-url>` is the URL of your repository on GitHub. This allows you to work on the project on your local machine, then push the changes back to GitHub.

Pushing changes to GitHub is the process of uploading your local repository changes to the remote repository hosted on GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Commit Your Changes Locally**: Before you can push changes to GitHub, you need to make some changes in your local repository and commit those changes. This could involve adding a new file, modifying an existing file, etc. The general process is to use `git add <file>` to stage changes, and then `git commit -m "Your message"` to commit them. 

2. **Check Your Remote**: By default, when you clone a repository from GitHub, Git creates a "remote" named "origin" that points to your GitHub repository. You can confirm this by running the command `git remote -v`. This should display the URLs of your remote repositories.

3. **Push Your Changes**: Once you've made and committed your changes, you can push them to GitHub with the `git push origin <branch>` command. Here, `<branch>` is the name of the branch you want to push. If you're working on the main branch, the command would be `git push origin main`.

4. **Enter Credentials**: If you're not already authenticated, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. If you've enabled two-factor authentication on GitHub, you'll need to create a personal access token and use that as your password. If you want to avoid entering your credentials every time, you can set up an SSH key or use a credential helper to remember your GitHub credentials.

Once the push command is successfully executed, your changes will be uploaded to GitHub and will be visible in the GitHub repository.

Remember, pushing only uploads the committed changes. If you've made changes that haven't been committed yet, they won't be included in the push. Always make sure to commit all the changes you want to upload before pushing.

Working with forks and pull requests is a common part of contributing to open source projects or collaborating with others on GitHub. Here's how you can do this:

**Forking a Repository**

1. **Find the Repository**: Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork.

2. **Fork the Repository**: In the upper-right corner of the page, click the "Fork" button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. 

This forked repository is independent of the original, but it retains a link to it. You can make changes to this repository without affecting the original project.

**Making Changes and Submitting a Pull Request**

1. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Once you have your own fork of the repository, you can clone it to your local machine to work on it. This is done using the `git clone <repository-url>` command, where `<repository-url>` is the URL of your forked repository on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Branch**: It's best practice to create a new branch for each set of changes you want to make. You can do this using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`, where `<branch-name>` is a descriptive name for the branch.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Make the changes you want to the codebase. This could involve editing existing files, adding new ones, or deleting files.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you're happy with your changes, you need to commit them to your branch. This is done using `git add <file>` to stage changes, and then `git commit -m "Your message"` to commit them.

5. **Push Your Changes**: After committing your changes, you can push them to your forked repository on GitHub using `git push origin <branch-name>`.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've pushed your changes to GitHub, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. To do this, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Pull requests" tab. Then click "New pull request". On the next page, click "compare across forks", confirm that the base repository is the original repository and the head repository is your fork, and confirm that the branches selected are the correct ones. Then click "Create pull request".

7. **Review and Merge**: At this point, it's up to the owner of the original repository (or someone they've delegated this responsibility to) to review your changes. They may choose to accept your pull request and merge it into the main codebase, or they may ask for some changes before this can happen.

Remember, always sync your fork with the original repository before making changes and submitting a pull request, to ensure you're working with the most up-to-date codebase. You can do this using `git fetch upstream` (assuming `upstream` is the name of the remote pointing to the original repository) and `git merge upstream/main`.

GitHub offers a suite of project management features that can greatly facilitate collaboration, including Issues, Projects, Actions, Discussions, and more. These features can be particularly useful for open source projects or teams using GitHub as their primary development platform.

**GitHub Issues**

GitHub Issues is a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects:

1. **Creating an Issue**: Anyone with read access to a repository can create an issue. From the repository's main page, click the "Issues" tab, then click "New issue". Give your issue a title and a description, label it appropriately, assign it to someone if applicable, and then click "Submit new issue".

2. **Labeling Issues**: Labels help categorize and filter issues. You can add them while creating a new issue, or to an existing issue.

3. **Closing an Issue**: When an issue has been resolved, you can close it. This is typically done by the person who opened the issue or by someone with write access to the repository.

**GitHub Projects**

GitHub Projects is essentially a Kanban board for managing project workflows:

1. **Creating a Project**: From a repository, click the "Projects" tab, then click "New project". Give your project a name, a description (optional), choose a template (optional), and click "Create project".

2. **Adding Cards**: Cards are used to represent tasks. They can be linked to issues or pull requests, or they can be standalone notes. To add a card, click the "+" button in a column.

3. **Moving Cards**: You can drag-and-drop cards between columns to reflect their status.

4. **Closing a Project**: Once all tasks have been completed, you can close the project. This is typically done by the project owner or someone with write access to the repository.

**GitHub Actions**

GitHub Actions help automate your software workflows:

1. **Creating an Action**: From a repository, click the "Actions" tab, then click "New workflow". You can start with a template or create a custom workflow.

2. **Configuring the Action**: Workflows are defined in `.yml` files in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. You can define what events trigger the workflow, what steps the workflow should take, and what actions those steps consist of.

3. **Monitoring the Action**: Once the workflow is committed to your repository, GitHub Actions will automatically run it whenever the trigger event occurs. You can monitor the status of these runs from the "Actions" tab.

**GitHub Discussions**

GitHub Discussions is a space for your community to have conversations, ask questions, and share ideas:

1. **Enabling Discussions**: From a repository, click the "Settings" tab, scroll down to "Features", and turn on "Discussions".

2. **Creating a Discussion**: From the repository's main page, click the "Discussions" tab, then click "New discussion". Give your discussion a title, choose a category, write your discussion, and click "Start discussion".

3. **Participating in a Discussion**: Anyone with read access to a repository can participate in a discussion by posting comments or reactions.

By using these features effectively, you can enhance your project's organization, increase transparency, encourage contribution, and streamline your development workflows.

Now that you've learned a lot about Git, GitHub, and its various features, let's review some key points and suggest some exercises to consolidate your knowledge:

**Review**

1. **Git Basics**: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.

2. **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. In addition to hosting code, it offers features that enhance the collaborative aspects of software development, like issues, pull requests, code review, and project management tools.

3. **Local and Remote Repositories**: You work on a local copy of your Git repository on your own machine and then push changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

4. **Branches**: Branches are used to isolate changes for specific features or tasks. The `main` (or `master`) branch typically contains the official version of a project.

5. **Forks and Pull Requests**: Forks are copies of repositories that you can modify without affecting the original project. Pull requests are proposals to integrate changes from one branch to another.

6. **GitHub Issues and Projects**: Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs, while the Projects feature provides a Kanban-style board for project management.

**Practice**

1. **Project Setup**: Create a new repository on GitHub. Clone it to your local machine, create a new file, commit the change, and push it back to GitHub. Try creating a new branch, making changes in this branch, and merging it back to `main`.

2. **Collaboration Simulation**: With a friend or colleague, try collaborating on a GitHub repository. You can both clone the repository, make and commit changes, and then try to push them back to GitHub. This will give you practical experience with pulling changes, resolving merge conflicts, and more.

3. **Fork and Pull Request**: Find an open source project on GitHub, fork it, make a change (it could be as simple as fixing a typo in the documentation), and submit a pull request. This is a common workflow when contributing to open source projects.

4. **Project Management**: Experiment with the Issues and Projects features in one of your GitHub repositories. Create a few issues, label them, and track their progress in a project board.

By practicing these exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Git and GitHub work and improve your efficiency and effectiveness when working on software development projects.
